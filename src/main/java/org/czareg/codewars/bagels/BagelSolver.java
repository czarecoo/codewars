/*
Here's a seemingly simple challenge. We're giving you a class called bagel, exactly as it appears below. All it really does is return an int, specifically 3.
See Bagel.class
The catch? For the solution, we're testing that the result is equal to 4. But as a little hint, the solution to this Kata is (almost) exactly the same as the example test cases.
