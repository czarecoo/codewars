A common exercise, when you're learning a new language, is to make a guessing game. It's a great way to learn control structures, IO, the works.

This is taking the guessing game to a whole new level. This time, you're the one playing the guessing game. And the guessing game is Math.random().

The task is really simple. You make a guess, Math.random() does it's thing, and if you're right 5 times out of 5, you win!

Don't guess the same thing every time.

Hint: You guess first.
